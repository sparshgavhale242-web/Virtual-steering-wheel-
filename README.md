🎮 Virtual Steering Wheel — MediaPipe + Python
Control any car game using your hands as a steering wheel — no hardware needed. Just your webcam.
How It Works
Hold both fists toward the camera like you're gripping a steering wheel. Tilt your hands to steer.
Both hands level  →  Straight (no key pressed)
Tilt LEFT         →  ← LEFT arrow key
Tilt RIGHT        →  → RIGHT arrow key
Remove hands      →  All keys released instantly
Requirements
Python 3.9+
Webcam
Install Dependencies
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pynput numpy
Run
python3 steering_wheel.py
Press Q in the camera window to quit.
macOS Setup ⚠️
This project was built and tested on macOS (Apple M2). On macOS you must grant camera permission to Terminal before running:
Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera
Enable access for Terminal (or your Python launcher)
Run the script again
Windows Setup
The script works on Windows with one small change. Open steering_wheel.py and find this line:
backend = cv2.CAP_AVFOUNDATION if platform.system() == "Darwin" else cv2.CAP_ANY
This line already auto-detects your OS — no manual change needed. On Windows it will automatically use cv2.CAP_ANY (DirectShow/MSMF).
Steps for Windows:
Install Python from https://python.org
Install dependencies:
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pynput numpy
Run:
python steering_wheel.py
If the camera doesn't open, try changing CAMERA_INDEX at the top of steering_wheel.py:
CAMERA_INDEX = 0   # try 0, 1, or 2
Note for Windows: You may see a Windows Security prompt asking if Python can access your camera — click Allow.
Config (top of steering_wheel.py)
Setting

Troubleshooting
Problem
Fix
[ERROR] Cannot open camera
Check CAMERA_INDEX — try 0, 1, 2
Steering is reversed
Toggle FLIP_CAMERA = False in config
Keys stuck after removing hands
Hands must be fully out of frame for ~8 frames
